Collaboration management/monitoring dashboard for CUCM, CMS & Expressway.

Also includes a provisioning system for CUCM to manage users, extension and devices.

This is mainly a template for a frontend dashboard portal without the backend logic. Data is either generated with JS in the frontend or provided by a mock backend script. This makes the frontend fully functional and with the option to replace the backend to use real data.
